# CITM02
# CAN In The Middle (CITM) - Dual channel CANBUS adapter built around Arduino

## About the Project

In order to interact with a vehicles data network, I needed to create a CAN Bus adapter. Following the initial proof of concept project (CITM1) a custom PCB was designed and sent out for manufacture. The CITM2 board includes dual can tranceivers to allow messages to be passed through the Arduino and ingerogated in real time. This allows message flow direction and can be used to identify signals belonging to a specific node on a CAN Bus.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

This projects assumes the use of an Arduino Pro Mini and a TJA1050 CAN Bus shield
